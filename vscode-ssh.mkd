# Steps to solve issues with vscode ssh not working properly
- Make sure .vscode-server is being installed in the proper location on the remote server. This can be changed in the Remote-SSH: Settings accessed via command+shift+p
- Kill the remote vscode-server via command+shift+p
- Manually delete the .vscode-server directly via a seperate terminal
- Disable the ExecServer option in the settings if it is not already
- Make sure that the server has enough space
- Check the error log by pulling up the terminal when attempting to ssh, going to output, and selecting Remote-SSH
- Downgrade the Remote-SSH extension or vscode
